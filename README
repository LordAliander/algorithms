Algorithm Implementations by Lord Aliander
==========================================

SORTING ALGS:
    The sorting algorithms range from easy to more complex. They work only with integer based arrays.
    The array has to be in its simplest form, meaning int[]. Every algorithm has it's own class and the
    list can be sorted by passing it to the *.sort(int[] array) -> int[] method.

SEARCH ALGS:
    Also the search algorithms range from easy to complex. Every algorithm has it's own class and the object
    can be searched calling the *.search(int[] array, int target) -> int method. This goes without saying but
    these algorithms only work on sorted arrays.

DATA COMPRESSION:
    This is more of a "Coding Adventure" for me. There is no utility for this kind of programs, but I find enjoyment 
    in trying to solve more complex problems.
